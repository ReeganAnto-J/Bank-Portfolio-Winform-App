#### Key skills I applied (In my humble opinion):
- Applying OOPs concept using C#
- File Handling
- Normalization and Specialization of data and files
- Exception handling
- Effecient state transwer
- Dynamic data handling from different files
- Basics of WinForms
- Using debugging tools offered by Visual Studio
- Problem solving
